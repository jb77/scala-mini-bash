## Scala For Fun & Profit

### About

Scala is a static typed hybrid object-oriented and functional programming language based on the JVM. Between the renaissance of functional programming in the development scene and its use in highly available, highly scalable platforms like Twitter, Tumblr and The Guardian, Scala has "crosssed the chasm" in terms of adoption.

Come on a journey through the Scala world from the starting point of 'Why Scala?' through tooling and challenges to advanced topics such as Implicits and Akka Actors. Find out how to integrate Scala with your existing Java libraries and use Play for low-ceremony stateless asynchronous web services and applications. The session will be suitable for novices and those with Scala exposure and will be tailored to the audience on the night.
